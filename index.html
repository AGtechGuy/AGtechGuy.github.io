    <h1>Why Apple is so OP</h1>

    <p>So to start Apple has a few of the best tech products in the world, im gonna mention 2 of them here, Macs and iPhones. They might be one of the most OP products in the market. Let's say you have money to buy Apple and you decide to start by an iPhone. You start to see that you win some features by buying other devices, and there is the moment when you have three options: A) You buy the other device, let's say a Macbook Air and then you enter the Apple ecosystem which is one of the hardest to exit; B) You resist and just keep the iPhone; C) You buy an Android and don't come back to Apple. If you enter the ecosystem, you will be happy but also waste a lot of money. Because let's say you buy a Macbook. You decide that it's too hard to use such a small screen so you buy a iMac, and afer a few time you decide you need more power so you get a iMac Pro, and during that process you might prefer using a pen to take some notes, so you buy a iPad and a Apple Pencil, but then you see you need a better pencil and more power to use it as a iOS Laptop. So you get a iPad Pro and buy some extras, and you realize a iPhone 11 Pro(or Pro Max) is better than your iPhone 11, so you buy it and then you see that a watch helps a lot so you buy a Apple Watch, and you keep getting so many Apple products that you just can't stop buying them. And that's why it's so hard to leave, because Apple offers a lot.</p>
